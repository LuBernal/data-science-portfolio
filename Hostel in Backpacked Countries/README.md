# Hostel Analysis and Price Predictor for Backpacker's Paradise 🌎🎒

In the year 2022, I had the incredible opportunity to embark on a long-awaited adventure backpacking through South America, with a special focus on Colombia, my father's homeland which I had never visited until then. Throughout my journey, I immersed myself in the vibrant culture, beautiful landscapes, and, like any seasoned backpacker, stayed in shared dorms at hostels. Upon my return, I was determined to undertake a data science project related to my trip. That's when the idea struck me - why not gather data from hostels across the countries I traversed, analyze it, and create a tool that provides backpackers with price estimates for their accommodation? 🏞️🌍

## Project Milestones 🏁

This project unfolds in four significant milestones, each represented by a Jupyter notebook:

1. [Web Scraping of Hostelworld.com 🌐🔍](https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Hostel%20in%20Backpacked%20Countries/Webscrapping%20of%20hostelworld.com.ipynb)

During my backpacking adventure, I relied heavily on the Hostelworld app to find accommodations. Leveraging my web scraping skills, I successfully collected valuable information on hostels listed in the app for the countries I visited. This data forms the foundation of our project.

2. [Data Cleaning and Validation 🧹✅](https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Hostel%20in%20Backpacked%20Countries/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Validation.ipynb)

After scraping the data from the website, there was still work to be done. Extensive cleaning and transformation were essential to maximize the potential of our dataset. I wanted to ensure accuracy and reliability in my analysis.

3. [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊🌟](https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Hostel%20in%20Backpacked%20Countries/Exploratoy%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

This phase satisfied my curiosity and addressed doubts about hostel trends across different countries. We delved into various aspects, including estimating the backpacker population in different parts of South America and identifying statistically significant differences in prices.

4. [Predictive Model for Shared Dorms Price 💰🛏️](https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Hostel%20in%20Backpacked%20Countries/Predictive%20model%20for%20Dorms.ipynb)

Here, I developed a powerful model capable of predicting hostel dorm prices based on an array of factors studied throughout the project. This predictive tool empowers backpackers to plan their trips more effectively by estimating accommodation costs based on destination and duration of stay (probably I should have created this before my trip...).

5. [Report Presentation 📢📈](https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Presentation.pdf)

The excitement generated by this project extended to friends and family who showed great interest in my findings. To cater to a broader audience, I prepared a non-technical presentation for them in which I showcased my  analysis and insights.

### Additional Content in the Folder 📂🌐

In addition to the Jupyter notebooks, this folder contains essential resources:

- CSV Files: Two files contain the raw hostel data before and after cleaning and validation. Two other CSV files, named *countriepop* and *worldcities*, were sourced from the internet and used for geographical mapping and calculating hostel and backpacker density based on city and country populations.

- Subfolder "ne_110m_admin_0_countries": This subfolder houses geographical information for South America, essential for plotting informative maps.
