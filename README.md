# Projects 📑

## [Bird Feeding Station Analysis](./Bird%20Feeding%20Station/) 🐦🏞️

### **Programming Language:** Python

### **Tools Used:** *Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pickle, Scipy.stats, Numpy, DateTime, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn (RandomForestClassifier, RandomizedSearchCV)*

<img align="left" width="220" height="220" src="https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other/Images/birds.png"> A close friend of mine works at a natural bird reserve where they set up a feeding station to support the local bird population. They record each bird's visit, including species and behavior. Intrigued, I proposed to analyze their data to gain insights and practice my data science skills. With their consent, I embarked on this project. 

I cleaned and preprocessed the data, performed exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and created visualizations. Additionally, I developed a machine learning model with XGBoost and RFC to predict bird species based on observed features during each visit.


## [Backpacking and Data Science: Hostel Analysis and Trip Price Estimator](./Hostel%20in%20Backpacked%20Countries/) 🌎🎒

### **Programming Language:** Python

### **Tools Used:** *Requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Scikit-Learn (linear_model, Lasso, Ridge), Pingouin, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas, Shapely, Numpy*

<img align="right" width="170" height="200" src="https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other/Images/llama.jpg"> In 2022, I fulfilled a long-held dream of backpacking through South America, particularly Colombia, my father's homeland. During my trip, I stayed in hostels extensively. After returning, I decided to analyze hostel data from the countries I visited, scraped from the Hostelworld platform.

I cleaned and validated the data, conducting analyses on topics such as backpacker density per country and price ranges among destinations. Additionally, I created a tool that uses a regression model to estimate the expenses a backpacker can expect based on their destination and desired hostel qualities.


## [Spanish Autonomies WordCloud using NLP](./WordCloud%20for%20Autonomies/) 💃☁️

### **Programming Language:** Python

### **Tools Used:** *TfidfVectorizer, WikipediaAPI, Spacy, WordCloud, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas, Numpy, Requests, BeautifulSoup, PIL*

<img align="left" width="230" height="215" src="https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other/Images/spain_wc.PNG"> My growing interest in NLP led me to undertake this project, inspired by the ["Most Recurring Word on Each Country’s Wikipedia Page"](https://brilliantmaps.com/recurring-wikipedia/) map from the book *Brilliant Maps*. I aimed to create a similar visualization but with more words, highlighting cultural differences within the autonomous communities in Spain.

I scraped text from Wikipedia articles of each autonomy using Wikipedia's API, applied NLP preprocessing techniques (lemmatization, stopwords removal), and used TF-IDF vectorization to emphasize word frequency differences. The results were transformed into word clouds and plotted on a map of Spain, highlighting each autonomy's unique word cloud.


## [Traffic in Recipes App](./Recipe%20App%20Traffic/) 🍳

### **Programming Language:** Python

### **Tools Used:** *Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingno, Numpy, Scikit-Learn (LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, GridSearchCV)*

<img align="right" width="217" height="152" src="https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other/Images/recipes.png"> This project was completed to earn the Data Science Professional certificate at DataCamp.com. I analyzed a dataset from a fictional recipe app, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and developing a machine learning model to predict whether displaying recipes on the main page would increase app traffic. It also involved presenting my findings to DataCamp. This was my first complete and independent data science project.
