# Bird Feeding Station 🐦📊

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio project where I had the unique opportunity to collaborate with a close friend working at a natural bird reserve! 🌿🦜

## Project Background 📜

At this remarkable reserve, they set up a feeding station equipped with motion-triggered cameras to observe and record the local bird population. The recorded observations were meticulously transcribed into an Excel sheet for analysis.

Upon hearing about this fascinating initiative, I eagerly volunteered to apply my data science skills to gain valuable insights from the collected data. My friend kindly agreed, with the sole condition of anonymizing the variables, mainly bird species, before sharing the results in my public portfolio.

## Project Milestones 🏁

This project is divided into three key milestones, each tackled in a separate Jupyter notebook:

1. [Data Cleaning and Validation 🧹✅](https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Bird%20Feeding%20Station/Feeding%20Station%20-%20Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Validation.ipynb)

In this initial phase, I assessed and cleaned the data, making necessary adjustments for further analysis. The goal was to optimize the dataset for downstream processing.

2. [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊🔍](https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Bird%20Feeding%20Station/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

The EDA notebook was dedicated to the exploration of various variables. We delved into intriguing patterns and relationships among them. A highlight was uncovering the presence of different bird species at the feeding station and their behavioral changes during breeding seasons.

3. [Multi-class Classification Model for Birds 🦉🤖](https://github.com/LuBernal/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Bird%20Feeding%20Station/Multi-class%20classification%20model%20for%20Birds.ipynb)

In this final milestone, I developed a predictive model to identify bird species based on their behavior at the feeding station. The model achieved an impressive overall accuracy of 87%, enabling us to classify different bird species accurately.

## Data Anonymization 🕶️🔒

To respect privacy and confidentiality, I've ensured that the data is anonymized, mainly by concealing specific bird species identities. For the same reason, the csv file containing the raw has not been uploaded. 

I invite you to explore each milestone and the insights gained from this remarkable collaboration with the natural bird reserve. 🌟📈
